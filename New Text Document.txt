Check Login Activity---------------------------------

Creates object of LoginPage. 
Reads Date and time using DateTimeFormater and LocalDateTime.

FileWriter and PrintWriter creates Loginactivity file to store the timestamps of the
login and logout activity.

After each login and logout activity the timestamps gets printed as logs in the 
LoginActivity file.


LoginActivity() reads the LoginActivity file and prints in terminal.  it read the file
line by line and if it encounters any non empty line it uses array to split the string
into desirable format. splitting the line with this symbol "," ,
by threee storing three variables in array index 0,1,2 of the array.

If the line qncountered is null it skips the line and goes to another line.




Give Attendance ---------------------------

We declare all the variables we are using in this class.
GiveAttendance is used for giving attendance only accesed by teachers.

For Attendence By Roll No. () the attendance is updated according to each roll no.

DataFormatter is used to convert the value obtained from the excel file into a string
format as the default read value cannot be used to print as string.

we use fileinputstream to read the excel file and intialize a new workbook to read the rows
and columns of the excel file.

getSheet gets the sheet at the specified index and we get the lastrow numer and the
last cell number of the row.

We iterate through the rows until we get the match for the roll no. and once we get a
match we store the r value (the row value) as var2 and set tf23 as false. If else,
tf23 is set as true and it prints "Roll No. Not found".


Now for updating attendance we print all the subjects and depending on selection,
ie. if it's 1 it sets g1 to "DsaAttended" and g2 to "DsaTotalClasess" and it does this for 
each clasess and it calls attendance() method where the actual attendance updation happens.

In attendance it reads the excel file using XSSFWorkbook and sets bg to get row0.
It then iterates through each columns (by cols using sheet.getrow.getlastcellnum())
and then if it stores the value of that cell and checks if it equals g1 and g2. If it
encounters the g1 and g2 values (ie. the subjects 'Attended' & 'Totalclases') the values of those
gets stored in var and var11 respectively.

No we get the row from var2 and the cells of "ClassAttended" And "Total Clasess" from
var and var11 respecitlvely. THis is done by XSFFROw and XSSFCell and the values in those
cells are stored as strings v34 and v342. 

Now we print each
